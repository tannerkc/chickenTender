# chickenTender

A React Native app using Google Places API to generate cards of nearby restaurants for users to swipe left or right with their friends. 
First restaurant that everyone swipes right on is where you'll all be happy going to eat.

Currently building user authentication and linking app to realtime database for match results.

## Issues:
currently the Moesif Origins & CORS chrome extension is required to run the web version of this app until I build a formal Node server
